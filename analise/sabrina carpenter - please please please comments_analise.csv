"I am def not the target demo for Sabrina Carpenter as a middle aged woman that primarily listens to electronica. This song is really good. The lyrics nail a very specific feeling that can happen in toxic relationships. I'll speak for myself here:  In a past toxic relationship,  was able to look away from lots of things to an extent. I could compartmentalize the bruising of my ego and heartbreak from the public embarrassment and blow to my reputation that comes with a partners bad behavior. I can't recall another song that has hit that real specific feeling. The lyrics are cleverly crafted and elevated with the bits of twang that come through. I had never heard this song outside of background music until her tiny desk show. That performance really highlighted the Country aspects of the songs she was playing, and what turned me onto this song specifically. She reminds me a little bit of Dolly in the best way possible. And now that I'm hearing this version of the song it's like a synthed out Dolly which is really cool. I never would've thought that kind of combination would work. Her harmonies are luscious too. This song has been burned into my brain for the last 72 hours. It scratches the right itches.","I classify this comment as Positive.

"I'm typically a pop fan tbh and I like Sabrina's voice, but this song is incredibly irritating. I think being embarrassed of your partner has gotta be one of the biggest red flags imo.
