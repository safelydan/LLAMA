"Hot take: not every powerful, badass woman who doesn't need a man is lesbian. In fact, the idea that they're lovers totally takes away from the actual story. It makes so much more sense and makes both characters cooler if they come out of the mess realizing that NEITHER of them need validation from a romantic relationship, and they become good friends because of their similar views. The last few seconds with the playful banter really confirms this: they both found a friend in each other, and they were willing to forgive each other for the beef between them. Not everything is LGBTQ.","I would classify this comment as Neutral, justifying my answer by saying that while it expresses a clear opinion about the interpretation of the music video's storyline, it does not contain overtly positive or negative language towards the artists, song, or genre, and instead focuses on making a point about representation and storytelling."

"Jenna, for the only scripted funeral that I’ve watched of your work, and having only two lines! “I don’t know how you put up with that.” “Very insecure.” It’s your non-vocals and pauses within the cameras still frame that captivates your audience.

The song is a vibe❤❤❤,I would classify this comment as Positive. The use of three heart emojis (❤❤❤) indicates strong enthusiasm and approval for the song.
"Mmmm...the song explores the theme of jealousy and the lingering bond between ex-lovers... Sabrina is really addressing someone who has gotten back together with his ex, insinuating that, despite the new relationship, the author’s presence is still palpable. The line “You’ll just have to taste me when he’s kissin’ you” expresses the idea that, even though the relationship is over, the author is still a part of his ex’s life... so much so that the new partner cannot help but feel his presence! It is also very strong the way Sabrina emphasizes how some of his ex’s habits and behaviors, such as jokes or affectionate gestures, were learned from him (I am referring to “He’s funny, now all his jokes hit different / Guess who he learned that from?”). This lyric maybe could seem ""trivial"", but... it is very deep indeed 😊😊","I classify this comment as Positive.
