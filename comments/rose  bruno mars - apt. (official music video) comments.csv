"1:10-1:36 and 2:09-end are probably my favorite sections. Them singing together, layering, the drone notes underneath that rise with the chord progression and the ""ahhh ah ah, ahhh ah ah, ahhhhh"" behind that just really make this feel almost bittersweet? Like a graduation, where you're celebrating a new beginning but its still the end of something and you're going through old memories and laughing, crying, smiling.
