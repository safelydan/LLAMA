"This video and song actually has me feeling so emotional right now. It so captures how it feels to be in a near death experience. TRUE STORY TIME: I was in a massive tent fire last year. I fell asleep in a tent and woke up to a propane tank blasting my upper left side with flaming propane, and a third of the tent on fire. I still have no idea what started the fire. But it was a homeless encampment and lots of them have been set on fire especially as of lately. I woke up to that and jumped out of the tent over some of the flames and when I looked back the place I was just sleeping was fully engulfed. By the time the firefighters had put it out, both the tent and all around it in a 15 metre radius was completely decimated. Anyways, when the paramedics gave me Ketamine to sedate me as I was panicking and going into shock with the burns on me, it felt exactly like this video. I was out of my mind on Ketamine but it was deeply spiritual. This is also how the fire felt. Everything was in slow motion. It felt like I was experiencing a lifetime in those moments. I also felt a heavy sense of foreshadowing. It felt like I was running against time and fate and wondering if I would make it to where I was running in time or not. This video perfectly captures that for me. Well done","I classify this comment as Positive, justifying my answer with: ""The commenter expresses deep emotional resonance with the song and video, recalling a traumatic experience and finding validation in its depiction."""
