"Bruno Mars distills galaxies into groove, every note a star collapsing into soul. Lady Gaga sculpts silence into spectacle, wielding emotion like fire spun through glass.

"JESUS CHRIST IS COMING VERY SOON,  He died for you, and wasting time on this earth ent worth it. Jesus is the answer to your pain, your sorrow, that heavy heart, he can fix your breathing problems, when you feel like you can't breathe properly, he can fix it. And mostly JESUS CHRIST is the only one who can full that emptiness in you, an emptiness that money, songs, food, and pleasure can not full, all these things are temporary. But JESUS, he would satisfy you unto eternity. I was lost in this world, and Jesus came to me. He can come to you too if you just repent and give your life sincerely to him, don't take it because JESUS wants it, and your life is worth living, if you just give it to him.",@jeliciafitzpatrick7171,2025-07-17T13:10:10Z,0
